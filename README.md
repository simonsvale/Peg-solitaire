# Peg-solitaire

Peg solitaire or just solitaire can be traced back to the late 1700 century. 
The game is played solo, though one is encouraged to solve it with multiple people.

The game is won if the player can eliminate all pegs, but the last, which should be standing in the middle of the board.
Any peg can be eliminated by selecting a peg and jumping over an adjacent peg and into an empty hole. 
The adjacent peg will now be removed from the board.

The game is made in C++, using the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries. 
The textures are made using Blender and Paint.net.

Controls:

r = reset  
z = undo move

As of now, the game only supports windows.
